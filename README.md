##üß™ Testing Strategy

This project employs a multi-layered testing approach:

1.  **Component Tests (Vitest):** Located alongside components (e.g., `*.test.tsx`), these tests use Vitest and React Testing Library to verify individual component logic and rendering in isolation. Run with `yarn test:components`. Coverage reports are generated via `yarn test:components:coverage`.
2.  **BDD/E2E Tests (Playwright/QuickPickle):** Feature files (`*.feature`) define application behavior in Gherkin syntax. Step definitions (`*.steps.ts` or `*.steps.tsx`) implement these behaviors using Playwright to interact with the browser (often against Storybook stories or the main app). Run with `yarn test:bdd`. These tests ensure features work correctly from a user's perspective. BDD test reports are generated automatically during the CI process.
3.  **Storybook Interaction Tests:** Storybook's `play` functions are used within stories (`*.stories.tsx`) to simulate user interactions and assert component states directly within the Storybook environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`) automates the following on pushes to the `main` branch:

1.  **Checkout Code:** Fetches the latest code.
2.  **Setup Node.js & Yarn:** Configures the environment and installs dependencies.
3.  **Install Playwright Browsers:** Ensures necessary browser binaries are available.
4.  **Build App:** Creates a production build of the Vite application.
5.  **Run Component Tests:** Executes Vitest tests and collects coverage.
6.  **Run BDD Tests:** Starts the Storybook server (`storybook:ci`) and runs Playwright BDD tests against it.
7.  **Build Storybook:** Creates a static build of the Storybook documentation site.
8.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Uploads the application build (`dist/`), Storybook build (`dist/storybook/`), component coverage report (`dist/coverage/`), and BDD test report (`dist/bdd-reports/`) as artifacts and deploys them to GitHub Pages.

The deployed sites and reports can be accessed via the links at the top of this README.
